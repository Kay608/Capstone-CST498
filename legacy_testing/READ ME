# ðŸ§ª Legacy Testing Scripts

This folder contains early test scripts used for local development.

- `face_register.py`: Captures and saves face encodings using your laptop/PC webcam. Only for development use.
- `face_recognizer.py`: Tests face recognition without needing the robot or Raspberry Pi.

These scripts are not used in the final deployment, but were helpful during early development.
